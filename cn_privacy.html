    <h1>CeramicNotifier Privacy Policy</h1>
  </header>
  <p>
  This is a very simple privacy policy, for my simple Glassware, CeramicNotifier. Here are the basics:
  <ul>
    <li>Anonymous metrics will be collected. This helps to understand usage, and make better decisions about development and features.</li>
    <li>Collection of email and auth tokens will be strictly to enable functionality within the app.</li>
    <li>There may be, at some point in the future, a server involved. This will only be used to enable more functionality.</li>
    <li>This app will be free, there will be no ads.</li>
    <li>None of your information will be sold to a third-party.</li>
    <li>None of your information will be given to a third-party for advertisement, or money making purposes.</li>
    <li>The only third-parties involved will be to enable analytics (Google Analytics for now), crash reports (Crashlytics), and a future hosted database (probably DynamoDB) for a future features.</li>
  </ul>
  You may contact me at ejohn _AT_ feigdev.com if you have any issues with this.
