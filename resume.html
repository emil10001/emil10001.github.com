              <dd>- Designed and wrote an Android app for a location based service. App
              polls GPS for current location and uploads to a service. GPS polling is
              done in the background, and there are several modes that the app will
              choose from based on a response from the server. App uses many parts of the
              Android SDK including location, network communication, file I/O, database

              ability to read in objects, and arithmetic operations that could be done on
              those objects via a script file. The intent was to build this into a
              transaction processing engine, but the project died before it could be
              implemented. However, it worked very well in testing.</dd>

              <dd>- Administered several CentOS, ArchLinux and Ubuntu Amazon EC2
              instances. Fixed and deployed Rails and Java software to those instances
              for customer demonstrations. Managed the databases, and migrated them
              between instances as needed. Administer version control systems on the main
              development server.</dd>
